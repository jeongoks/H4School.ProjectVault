# School project about hashing and encryption.
This is a school project to help me get a better understanding and usage of hashing and encryption.

It will be done in a Console application with a sort of Menu system to make it easy for a user to navigate and be guided with instructions on what to do when; there isn't much of a styling done to it, as the functionality is most important.

## Requirements:
- [x] Make a menu to navigate.
- [x] Add a password.
- [x] Hash and add salt to the password.
- [x] Option to show the newly added password and it's hashed code.
- [ ] xUnit test on the methods used to hash.

### Extra requirements if there's time.
- [x] Save the added passwords to a file and encrypt it.
- [ ] Open a file to view the encrypted files.
- [ ] Decrypt the encrypted file.
- [ ] Open a file to view the now decrypted file in the console.
